# Summary


# Fields of interest
My main field of research -my PhD subject- is causal discovery out of observational data, in the directed graph setting. I'm also interested in :

1. Generative models
2. Reinforcement Learning
3. Computer hardware

# Causal Discovery Toolbox
Along with my reasearch work, with Olivier Goudet we are developing a python 3 package for causal discovery out of observational data. 

It is still in development, but many of its features are already available. It includes :

1. Graph utilities and management
2. Metrics of evaluation for graphs
3. Many of the pairwise causal discovery algorithms
4. An extensive list of feature selection and graph recovery methods
5. Automatic hardware detection (CPU cores, GPUs) and adapting the algorithms to it.

The package is available at : [https://github.com/Diviyan-Kalainathan/CausalDiscoveryToolbox](https://github.com/Diviyan-Kalainathan/CausalDiscoveryToolbox)
